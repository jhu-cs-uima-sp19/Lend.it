# Lend.it

The features that we have completed so far are logging in/signing up, viewing posts on the main feed, creating asks and borrows, viewing individual post pages,user profiles, and the frontend aspects of messaging. Messaging, ratings, the population of the neighbors list have all been slated for sprint 2. 

We also did not fully implement authentication, but we verify email addresses by the inclusion of the "@" symbol, and check email addresses for existence in our database. Password authentication has not yet been implemented, but an email address that we have been using to test is rsashti1@jhu.edu.
